# Online Food Ordering Platform

## Project Overview
This is an online food ordering platform that allows users to view a menu and place an order by directly chatting with a vendor via WhatsApp. The project enables users to place an order by clicking the "Order Now" button, which directs them to a WhatsApp chat where they can specify their order.

## Features
- **Menu Display:** View available food items (could be implemented as a menu or catalog).
- **Order Now Button:** A button that allows customers to instantly contact the vendor via WhatsApp.
- **Pre-filled Message:** When a user clicks the "Order Now" button, the message "Hello, I'd like to order some food" is automatically populated in the WhatsApp chat, making it easier for customers to place their orders.
